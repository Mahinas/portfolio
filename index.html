      <h3>LADLE TRACKING SYSTEM</h3>
      <img src="images/completion_certificate.jpeg" alt="completion_certificate" />

      <pre>
-Developed software for ladle tracking using QR code technology with pyzbar and openCV, utilizing a tkinter framework and included user authentication for enhanced security.

- Utilized advanced object detection using yolo algorithm to efficiently track ladles and employed OCR to extract unique numbers for accurate identification.

- Applied preprocessing techniques including grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, blurring, thresholding, and contour identification to optimize images for OCR.

      <p>
        To minimize the reliance of auxiliary battery on the main traction battery by powering auxiliary systems through a combined renewable energy source
        such as piezoelectricity and solar power. The output voltage is regulated using the XG-Boost machine learning algorithm to optimally tune the PI
        controller, ensuring efficient and stable power delivery to auxiliary systems.
